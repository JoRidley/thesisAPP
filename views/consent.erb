<div class='body-text'>This is a research project conducted under the Cognitive Science Department at Vassar College. In this experiment, you will be asked to create a user account, consisting of a unique user name and password, for a specific website and attempt to accurately log back in within a specified duration of time. This experiment investigates how different factors of constructing a password allows for a greater accuracy of authentication. The entirety of the experiment is expected to take approximately [5-20] minutes to complete. This includes creating the user account, logging in to the specific site at a later time, and completing a short survey. Your personal information (name, email address, or Internet Protocol (IP) address) will not be associated with your data and will combined with other data to be analyzed for this experiment. You are free to stop the experiment at any time by simply closing your browser window.
